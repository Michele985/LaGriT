<blockquote><b><u><font face="Times">REGION</font></u></b>
<blockquote>Define a geometric region from the set of surfaces by logically
combining the surface names.&nbsp; A region may be removed from the geometry
by specifying the release keyword.
<p>To define a region, the operators <b>lt, le, gt, and ge</b> are applied
to previously defined surfaces according to the following rules.
<blockquote><b>lt</b> -- if the surface following is a volume then lt means
inside not including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane
or a sheet lt means the space on the side of the plane or sheet opposite
to the normal not including the plane or sheet itself.
<br><b>le</b> -- if the surface following is a volume then le means inside
including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet
le means the space on the side of the plane or sheet opposite to the normal
including the plane or sheet itself.
<br><b>gt</b> -- if the surface following is a volume then gt means outside
not including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane or a
sheet <b>gt</b> means the space on the same side of the plane or sheet
as the normal not including the plane or sheet itself.
<br><b>ge</b> -- if the surface following is a volume then ge means outside
including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet
<b>ge</b>
means the space on the same side of the plane or sheet as the normal including
the plane or sheet itself.
<br>The operators or, and, and not applied to surfaces mean union, intersection
and complement respectively. The parentheses operators, (and ), are used
for nesting. Spaces are required as delimiters to separate all operators
and operands. Internal interfaces should be included in exactly one region.
In the event of conflicting region commands, the one occurring last in
the input stream takes precedence.
<p>Defining a&nbsp; region will cause the information associated with this
material region to be stored under the name of the <a href="../geometries.html">geometry
</a>of the current mesh object.&nbsp; Releasing the&nbsp; region will remove
this information.</blockquote>
