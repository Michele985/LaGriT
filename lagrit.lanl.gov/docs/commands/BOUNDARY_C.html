    <p>Calculate the number of connected components of a mesh. This is useful 
for looking for holes in a mesh or as a diagnostic when looking at a single 
material (itetclr, imt) and determining if the material is contiguous or broken
into multiple pieces. </p>
         
    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the <strong>node</strong> option
is invoked, the boundary_components&nbsp;     module adds the node attribute
    <strong>numbnd</strong> and <strong>id_numb</strong> to the current mesh
object to which is written     the node number of a representative node of
each outside boundary component. In this mode 'connected' means that a set
of nodes of type 'outside' (itp = 10 or 12) can be traversed via element
edges that have both vertices of type 'outside'. This method is not really
fool proof in detecting holes in a mesh since one can traverse from the exterior 
of a mesh to an interior hole in the mesh via an edge that is not really a
boundary edge. More coding could deal with this situation. In addition, the
number of connected boundary components and a representative     node number
from each boundary component is assigned to the <strong>numbnd</strong> array.
The number of nodes in each boundary set is printed.&nbsp;Non-boundary nodes
are assigned <strong>numbnd</strong> = 0.  If the itp array is not current,
it must be     updated first, with the command <b>resetpts/itp.</b></font> 
By default resetpts/itp is called when the node option is invoked so the reset/noreset
is optional. The node array <b>id_numb</b> is similar to <b>numbnd</b> in
that nodes associate with the same boundary component have the same integer
value, however <b>id_numb</b> is assigned values starting with 1 and going
up to the number of boundary components in sequential order. </p>
         
    <p>When the <strong>node / material_id_number</strong> option is invoked, 
the distinction of boundary nodes as defined by itp array value is ignored. 
Instead, all nodes with imt = material_id_number are examined and the number 
of edge connected components is determined for just that material. Nodes with
imt <font face="Symbol">&sup1;</font> material_id_number are assigned numbnd
= 0. </p>
         
    <p>When the <strong>element</strong> option is invoked, the element attribute 
    <strong>numbnd_e</strong> is added to the current mesh object. The number 
of connected components of the mesh is computed where 'connected' means sets 
of elements can be traversed via the element faces. The attribute numbnd_e 
is filled with the element number of a representitive element of a connected 
set. <font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition, the number of connected 
 components and a representative     element number from each connected component 
and the number of elements in each connected component set is printed.&nbsp;</font>When 
the material_id_number option is invoked, only elements with itetclr = material_id_number 
are examined. Elements with itetclr <font face="Symbol">&sup1;</font> material_id_number 
are assigned <strong>numbnd_e</strong> = 0.</p>
