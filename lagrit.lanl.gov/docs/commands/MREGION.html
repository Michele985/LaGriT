<blockquote><b><u><font face="Times">MREGION</font></u></b>
<blockquote>Define a material region from a set of surfaces by logically
combining the surface names and region names. A material region may be
removed from the geometry by specifying the release keyword.
<p>To define material rgion, the operator <b>lt, le, gt</b>, and <b>ge</b>
are applied to previously defined surfaces according to the following rules.</blockquote>

<dir>
<dir>
<dir><b>lt </b>-- if the surface following is a volume then <b>lt</b> means
inside not including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane
or a sheet lt means the space on the side of the plane or sheet opposite
to the normal not including the plane or sheet itself.
<p><b>le </b>-- if the surface following is a volume then <b>le </b>means
inside including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane or
a sheet le means the space on the side of the plane or sheet opposite to
the normal including the plane or sheet itself.
<p><b>gt </b>-- if the surface following is a volume then <b>gt</b> means
outside not including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane
or a sheet <b>gt</b> means the space on the same side of the plane or sheet
as the normal not including the plane or sheet itself.
<p><b>ge </b>-- if the surface following is a volume then <b>ge</b> means
outside including the surface of the volume. If the surface is a plane
or a sheet <b>ge </b>means the space on the same side of the plane or sheet
as the normal including the plane or sheet itself.</dir>
The operators <b>or, and</b>, and <b>not</b> applied to regions or modified
surfaces mean union, intersection and complement respectively. Parentheses
are operators and are used for nesting. Spaces are required as delimiters
to separate operators and operands; parentheses are operators and must
be surrounded by spaces. Internal interfaces should be excluded when defining
material regions. (i.e. use <b>lt</b> and <b>gt</b> ). External boundaries
should be included when defining material regions. If a material regions
consists of more than one region and the regions touch (i.e. share a region
interface), then the region interface is not a material interface -- all
the points on the region interface are interior to the material region.
In this case use <b>le </b>or<b> ge</b> to include these region interface
points in the material region as interior points.
<p>Defining a material region will cause the information associated with
this material region to be stored under the name of the<a href="../geometries.html">
geometry </a>of the current mesh object.&nbsp; Releasing the material region
will remove this information.
