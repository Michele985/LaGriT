<B>region</B></A> command is used to divide the enclosing volume into regions.
The directional operators <B>lt</B>, <B>le</B>,<B> gt</B>,<B> </B>and <B>ge
</B>are applied to previously defined surfaces according to the following
rules.</FONT>
<DIR>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>lt -- </B>if the surface following
is a volume then <B>lt </B>means inside not including the surface of the
volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet <B>lt </B>means the space
on the side of the plane or sheet opposite to the normal not including
the plane or sheet itself.</FONT>
 
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>le -- </B>if the surface following
is a volume then <B>le</B> means inside including the surface of the volume.
If the surface is a plane or a sheet <B>le </B>means the space on the side
of the plane or sheet opposite to the normal including the plane or sheet
itself.</FONT>
 
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>gt -- </B>if the surface following
is a volume then <B>gt</B> means outside not including the surface of the
volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet <B>gt</B> means the space
on the same side of the plane or sheet as the normal not including the
plane or sheet itself.</FONT>
 
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>ge -- </B>if the surface following
is a volume then <B>ge</B> means outside including the surface of the volume.
If the surface is a plane or a sheet <B>ge</B> means the space on the same
side of the plane or sheet as the normal including the plane or sheet itself.</FONT></DIR>
</DIR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">In region comands, surface names must
be preceeded by a directional operator. The logical operators <B>or</B>,
<B>and</B>, and <B>not</B> mean union, intersection and complement respectively.
Parentheses are operators and are used for nesting. Spaces are required
as delimiters to separate operators and operands. To define the two regions
created by the plane bisecting the unit cube:</FONT>
<DIR>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>region</B>/top/ <B>le</B> cube
<B>and</B> <B>gt</B> cutplane /</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><B>region</B>/</FONT>bottom<B> /
le</B> cube <B>and le </B>cutplane <B>/</B></DIR>
</DIR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The region <I>bottom </I>contains the
interface <I>cutplane</I>; top contains none of the interface. Interior
interfaces must be included in one and only one region.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">If a region touches an external
boundary, include the surface that defines the enclosing volume in region
and mregion commands. For example, the regions <I>top</I> and <I>bottom</I>
are enclosed by the surface <I>cube</I></FONT></DIR>
