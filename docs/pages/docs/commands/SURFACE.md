# SURFACE #

Defines a boundary, interface, or geometry for a selected mesh object. The **release** will release the previously defined surface referenced by name.  All references will be removed from the geometry data structures and all constraints (icr) values associated with this surface will be removed.

## FORMAT ##

<pre>
<b>surface</b>/isurname/ ibtype / istype / surface-parameters

<b>surface</b>/isurname/ ibtype /<b>sheet</b>/cmo_name

<b>surface</b>/isurname/<b>release</b>
</pre>


*`isurname`* is the name of the surface and must be unique for each surface defined by **surface**.


*`ibtype`* defines the boundary type with keywords **free**, **intrface**, **reflect, intrcons** or
**virtual**. Nodes on **reflect**, **intrcons**, or **virtual** interfaces will be assigned
node constraint (icr) values corresponding to the surfaces on which the nodes sit. The
command **settets** will generate parent/child node chains (isn) for nodes on **intrface** or **intrcons** surfaces.

* **`free`**  can be used for external boundaries.

* **`reflect`** can be used for external boundaries, assigned constraint values (icr).

* **`intrface`** for interior interfaces, will generate parent/child node chains (isn).

* **`intrcons`** for constrained internal interfaces, are assigned constraint values (icr) and will generate parent/child node chains (isn). 

* **`virtual`** used for internal surfaces which have different materials on either side of the virtual interfaces do not
separate material regions but are intended to identify other structural features of a geometry. Nodes on this surface will be assigned constraint values (icr).



*`istype`* are the surface parameters and are specified with the
surface type in mind. 

**box** Where xmin,ymin,zmin and xmax,ymax,zmax are the coordinates of opposite corners of a cube, i.e bottom left and top right corners.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/sbox_name/ ibtype / <b>box</b> /xmin,ymin,zmin / xmax,ymax,zmax/
</pre>

**cylinder** Where point 1 is the bottom center and point 2 is the top center of the cylinder. radius is the radius of the cylinder. Cylinders are open but finite.  To create a closed cylinder cap both ends with planes.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>cylinder</b> x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2/ radius
</pre>

**cone** Where point 1 is the vertex and point 2 is the top center of the cone with radius from that point. A cone is finite but does have an open end. To create a closed cone cap the open end with a plane.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>cone</b> /x1,y1,z1/x2,y2,z2/radius/
</pre>

**ellipse** Where point 1 is the center of the ellipsoid and point 2 is on the a semi-axis (new x), point 3 is on the b semi-axis (new y). The values ar, br, cr are radii on their respective semi-axes.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>ellipse</b> / x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3 / ar, br, cr /
</pre>

**parallel** (piped) Where points 1, 2, 3 are the front left, front right and back left points of the base and point 4 is the upper left point of the front face.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>parallel</b> / x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3 / x4,y4,z4 
</pre>

**plane** Planes are infinite and their direction normal to the plane is determined by the order of the points according to the right hand rule. 
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>plane</b> or <b>planexyz</b>/ x1,y1,z1 / x2,y2,z2 / x3,y3,z3
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>planertz</b> / radius1, theta1, z1, radius2, theta2, z2, radius ,zcen/
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>planertp</b> radius1,theta1,phi1, radius2,theta2,phi2, radius3,theta3,phi3/ xc, yc, zc
</pre>

**sphere** Where xc, yc, zc are the sphere center and radius is distance from center point to sphere surface.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ ibtype / <b>sphere</b> / xc, yc, zc, radius
</pre>

**sheet** surfaces can be defined by cmo_name that is a 2D quad or triangle connected mesh object. See below for a description of inside/outside or left/right with respect to sheet surfaces.
<pre>
<b>surface</b>/s_name/ <b>sheet</b> / cmo_name
</pre>

**tabular** (rotated tabular profile) Where point 1 and point 2 define the axis of rotation for the tabular profile with point 1 as the origin. This is followed by pairs of profile descriptors depending on the value of geom. Ifgeom is set to **rz**, then the r value is a radius normal to the axis of rotation and z is the distance along the new axis of rotation. If geom is set to **rt** then theta is the angle from the axis of rotation at point 1 and r is the distance from point 1 along theta. The first pair must start on a new line and all lines must contain pairs of data. The last pair of data must be followed by **end**. Note the use of **&** as a line continuation for the command.

### inside/outside with respect to sheet surfaces ##

Inside/outside  will be determined by the following algorithm:

* For the point being considered, p, find the nearest sheet triangle
and the closest point, q, to p that lies on that triangle.

* Construct the vector <img height="20" width="`20" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif">, from q to p.

* Construct the outward normal to the triangle, <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">

The outward normal is constructed using the right hand rule and the order of the
points in the sheet. Sheets may be specified as quad Mesh Object (i.e. a
2 dimensional array of points containing the coordinates of the corners
of each quad). Either two triangles (divide each quad in two using point
(i,j) and (i+1,j+1)) or four triangles (add a point in the center of the
quad) are generated by each quad. Applying the right hand rule to the
points (i,j), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) gives the direction of the normal for
all triangles created from the quad.

* If <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  &lt; 0 then
the point is inside. IfÂ  <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  &gt;0 the
point is outside. If <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  * n = 0, and if
p is on the triangle then p=q and p in on the triangle.

* If <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image255.gif"> <img height="10" width="10" src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image256.gif">  = 0 and p is not on the triangle then p is outside.

<img src="https://lanl.github.io/LaGriT/assets/images/Image257.gif"> 

One implication of this definition is that the concept of shadows cast
by open sheets no longer is valid. Sheets may be considered to extend to
the boundary of the geometry.
