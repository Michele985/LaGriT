# interpolate/voronoi



## Example 1: show results from using the **`interpolate/voronoi`** (nearest node) method.


 For each point in the sink grid, the nearest node is found from the
 source or background grid. The attribute value associated with the
 sink point is assigned the attribute value from the source node.

 The output consists of GMV files.

 The input consists of AVS and GMV files. The input deck has 15 Examples of the interpolate command.

## Example 1:


 The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to find the nearest node in the source coarse hex mesh to each sink node of a refined triangle mesh. The imt value of each nearest source node attribute is copied to the sink imt
 attribute. 
 
 This image shows the imt attribute colors of the source hex mesh and the refined triangle sink mesh.

 The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to find the
 nearest node in a quad grid and copy imt values to sink quad grid.
 Image shows both the irregular quad grid and the refined quad sink
 grid.

 The objective is to test the ability of **interpolate** to find the
 nearest node in a tet sphere and copy to a 2D triangle sphere surface.
 The 2D surface has a radius slightly smaller than the 3D sphere. Image
 on left is the 3D tet sphere. Image on right is the triangulated
 surface with imt values copied from the 3D source sphere. The ends
 have been cutaway to show the surface elements.
