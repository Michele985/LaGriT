# For Developers

## Documentation Compilation

Documentation is found in the `tinerator/docs` folder and is written in Markdown.
The static site is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) using the
[Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Required MkDocs Extensions

| Package         | Command                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| MathJax         | `pip install pymdown-extensions` |
| Codehilite      | `pip install pygments`           |
| Materials theme | `pip install mkdocs-material`    |

### Viewing the Site

After all requirements are resolved, run

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

to start the local server. Navigate your web browser to the
local server address (i.e., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) to view.
MkDocs will automatically reload the static site upon any detected
file change within the `docs/` folder.


### Site Deployment

To deploy the site to GitHub pages, run

```bash
null
```

!!! note
    This manual process will eventually be phased out in support for TravisCI-based
    continuous deployment. Pull requests on this topic are welcome.
